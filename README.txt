##Implementation of Motion Planning on Baxter##

Pick and place operation of an object avoiding the obstacles on the table using Baxter Robot in simulated environment
There are two blocks, one on each table. Each block should be picked from its current table and placed safely on the other table, starting with the red block. 
Using Gazebo for simulation- Here we provided the instruction for Gazebo (Gazebo/Moveit/Rviz)

Instructions to run the project can be seen in presentation file.

Pick&Place.mp4 provides the pick and place operation of the baxter robot avoiding obstacles.
WaypointsCalculations.mp4 shows detailed steps of finding the waypoints.
